Pitivi is a very promising Open Source video editor software. It is based on Gstreamer, Gnonlin development libs.

Please have a look at <a href="http://pitivi.org">PiTiVi.org</a> 

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sarathlakshman/Gsoc/photo#5219388739850748146"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/sarathlakshman/SG7-Z8d6QPI/AAAAAAAAANE/bsVHp5doOKk/s400/pitivi.png" /></a>

It is still under initial stages of development. Hence it still requires lots of features to be added to be used a professional video editing software. As the part of Google Summer of Code 2008, I am working with PiTiVi to add certain features like record from webcam, capturing network stream etc. 

Please checkout from svn to get the latest version.
