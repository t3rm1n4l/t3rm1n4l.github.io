    Somehow I don't like RPM based distros :(

Last day, I was in panic and was trying to figure out some way to transfer three Video DVD images (of 4 GB each ) to my desktop from laptop. It would take a lot of time if I am sending these files through LAN or transferring through other media. My parents were restless in watching the Marriage party video from those DVDs. Since I was busy with some other business I wasn't able to give away my laptops to my parents for watching the video.

Finally <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>, VideoLAN project came to my help. I decided to broadcast video through WLAN network at home :) It was awesome. I could do all my works sitting at some corner at my home and they could watch the video without my disturbance.

The broadcast server
