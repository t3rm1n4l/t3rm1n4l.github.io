  content: "Hello Sarath,\r\nAre all your mp3 audio files copyrighted? If yes then
    how do say that you are free? Converting audio files from mp3 to ogg will not
    let you free as in Freedom. If you have converted audio files which does not have
    any copyright then you are right. \r\n\r\nMay be I am wrong. Pardon me.\r\n\r\nHoping
    your reply to the above email id."

Being a free software enthusiast, it was shame for myself keeping music files in a proprietary format like mp3. During some chat conversation with <a href="http://aeshyamae.blogspot.com">Shyam</a> I recalled the thought. I never went for a second thought.  Wrote a bash script and converted all my music files to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis"> ogg vorbis</a> format :). Now I'm free. 

<blockquote>Free as in Freedom</blockquote>

Ogg Vorbis is a free and open source replacement for mp3 music format. More than the freedom thought, I have found some more benefit. After conversion from mp3 to ogg, I freed some more disk space.  ( 1.5 Gigs to 1.2 Gigs ) :)

{% highlight bash %}
find base_dir_path -type f -name "*.mp3" > list ;
while read each_file;
     dir2ogg "$each_file";
     rm "$each_file" ;
 done < list ;
 {% endhighlight %}
