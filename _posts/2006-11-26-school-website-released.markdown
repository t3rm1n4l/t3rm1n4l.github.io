  content: I know it's a bit late, but congratulations on your site. I don't know
    html that much but web designing is a lot of hard work. I know a couple of friends
    who went through the same thing in creating websites. They tell me it's quite
    tiring at times so kudos to you.

Our School Website released. The site is developed by five students including me in our class. The idea was put forwarded by me and worked with much leverage...I lead the team. It was really hard to co-ordinate since our school management is much worse. Also most teachers are technically blinds!! (Just wait till I finish my school to review on it :D). Only pure FOSS tools for building it. We have been working for the recent month for putting this idea to reality.
St Joseph's Higher Secondary School, Thalassery has been a part of history of Thalassery. Now its pleasure to have an official website for our school. This is a real contribution our school from us. Our website team members are Rahul Anand, Rinil K.V, Anagha C, Harshida Chandran.
It had been a head ache for Rahul and me to make school authorities to put fund for hosting...Finally a sponsor came and everything went fine. Yesterday, Saturday 25th Nov, Sri.

Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, Honourable Home Minister of Kerala inaugurated the official launch of <a href="http://www.stjosephshss.info">www.stjosephshss.info</a>.

Please have a look at the site and post some comments !
