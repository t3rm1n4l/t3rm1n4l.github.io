Hi all.

I am back after the awesome FOSS NITC 2006 conference. It was a very nice experience.

On 18th Sat, I went to <a href="http://nitc.ac.in">NIT (Former REC), Calicut</a> for doing a Workshop/Talk 'The Live CD Workshop'. It was 9:40 am when I reached there. Then inaugaration ceremony was going on. I met Amarjith singh, the organiser of the program and he told me sorry that there was some changes in program schedule. No problem, I was 100% ready to do talk at anytime. There were so many speakers from Bangalore. Three of them were from Yahoo. Gopal V, Kalyan Varma, Philip Tellis, Praveen, Dilip, Premshree Pillai, Shreekumar, Shreyas Srinivasan, Pradeepto, Shyam Mani, Aanjhan R, Kushal Das were the other speakers. NIT was the first engineering college that I ever visisted. The college has a pleasurefull environment. Students in the college are also encouraging. I could find some good friends there.

I really enjoyed the FOSS event. I missed some of the talks due to schedule of my talk. My workshop was conducted at NITC computer Lab. Actually NITC guya expected a hands on workshop. But I conducted a demo based talk with a practical session. No hands on. So many students at NITC asked me doubts and I was happy in answering and clearing their doubts. In the evening I found out my old friend, Varun Narayan who was my schoolmate before two years. I got a good company with him there.

<a href="http://pravi.co.nr">Praveen</a>, <a href="http://dilpu.net">Dilip</a>, <a href="http://kushaldas.blogspot.com">Kushas Das</a> and <a href="http://slynux.org">me</a> engaged in some technical as well as funny talks at guest house and finally slept. Kushal gave me a nice Fedora Core community T-shirt.

On the second day, I felt my health condition very bad due to cold and headache. So I sat off mooded at the seminar hall listened at the talks.  My enthusiasm was hooked up by Kalyan Varma's Application security talk. He showed some interesting stuffs like security holes in popular websites ..& little stuffs. It was really interesting. After his session, I asked him some doubts too. Shreyas Sreenivasan's FOSS Foundry talk was very nice. He is a cool guy.  He demonstrated some FOSS projects and finally Xgl Live CD, which was really amazing. It included a future desktop environment which was so flexible. To know more.<a href="http://kororaa.org/static.php?page=static060318-181203">. click here.</a>  I missed a lot of talks. I felt very sad.

Finally it was closing Cerimony, Mohandas sir gave us momentos. We posed for some group photos and left. Thus FOSS@NITC came to the end.
