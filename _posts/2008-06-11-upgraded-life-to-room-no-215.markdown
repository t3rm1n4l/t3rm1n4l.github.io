Hi,

It seems like I have undergone a nice update with my life routine at hostel. With special permission from hostel Warden, I am allotted <a href="http://www.mec.ac.in">Model Engineering College</a> Hostel, Room No: 215 for next three months. Yea its fun. Its a single room. Now it  feels more productive.

I have now access to College Wifi and internet. Also I have LAN connectivity of hostel network.

Finally its about the end of "Life without connectivity".

Now. I am in the mid Ist year university exams. Five exams out of nine is over by today and yet four more to be completed. I am planning to work seriously on code for <a href="http://www.pitivi.org">PiTiVi</a>.

By July Ist of June I will be entering new domain of Semester 3.

Happy hacking !
