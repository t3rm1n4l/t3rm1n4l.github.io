There is an interesting piece of news about PiTiVi that it is being offered funding for development by <a href="http://www.collabora.co.uk/">Collabora</a>. Following the hiring of PiTiVi project leader, <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/edwardrv/">Edward Hervey</a> Collabora has also hired <a href="http://dotsony.blogspot.com/">Branden Lewis</a> ( My colleague for google summer of code work with PiTiVi ) for part time.

Check out the news on <a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/152464"> linux.com</a>.

I feel very great with PiTiVi's development being a contributor for latest release <a href="http://www.pitivi.org/wiki/Downloads">PiTiVi 0.11.2</a> &ldquo;Milanesa de Lomo&rdquo;.
