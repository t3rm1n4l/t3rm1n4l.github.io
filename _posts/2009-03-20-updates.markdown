  content: "Hey,\r\nI really liked your article about UDev in LFY Dec '08 , and decided
    to try out the automatic connect to internet using our usb modem. I had to already
    add a rules file in udev in order to get the modem working and so i thought i
    would just have to add a few lines to this existing file to get this working.
    However, although it does connect to the internet when plugged in , it does not
    display the notification. Also, the script runs infinitely , displaying an error
    message:\r\n/usr/bin/msg_connection: line 11: [[-n: command not found\r\n\r\nhere
    is my rules file:\r\n~$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/026_ti_usb_3410.rules\r\n#TI

    &amp;\r\n/usr/bin/msg_connection con &amp;  \r\n\r\n--------------------eof-------------------\r\n\r\nand
    here is the msg_connection file:\r\n:~$ cat /usr/bin/msg_connection\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nuser=thulir;\r\n\r\nif
    [$# -eq 0];\r\nthen\r\n        DISPLAY=:0.0 su $user -c 'notify-send -u critical
    \"Internet Disconnected !\"';\r\nelse\r\n\r\nwhile true;\r\ndo\r\nif [[-n $(/sbin/ifconfig
    ppp0 2>&amp;1 | grep \"inet addr\")]];\r\n        then \r\n                DISPLAY=:0.0
    su $user -c 'notify-send \"Connected to Internet :)\"';\r\n        exit 0;\r\nfi\r\n
    \       sleep 1;\r\ndone\r\nfi\r\nexit 0;\r\n\r\n--------------------eof-------------------\r\n\r\nI
    think it may probably be just a typo in my scripts - if so , really sorry to make
    you go through them - but unfortunately i dont know enough shell script to debug
    it myself.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot."

    be given proper spacing.\r\n\r\n[$# -eq 0]; - > [ $# -eq 0 ];\r\n\r\nadd corresponding

It has been a long time since I blogged, I am back again.

Life at college has been becoming so hectic with pathetic Assignments, Class tests routine. Moreover we are running out of time since this is a short semester. Waiting for the vacation to come sooner so that I can resume my contribution to some of the Open Source Projects I love.
