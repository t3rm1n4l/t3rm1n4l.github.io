Finally I reached the Debian GNU/Linux planet, <a href="http://www.mec.ac.in">Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara</a> in today's 2nd allotment. 

It's a day of great fun. Today I turned 18. I'm got my birthday present. I'm alloted to Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara where I could find great fun with GNU/Linux.
