  content: '[...] Look at my old post: Splitter CPP [...]'
---
In connection with my Computer Science Project work, I wrote a file splitter program. A simple C++ program. This is tuned to compile with my favourite g++ compiler. It may need some modifications to compile on some platforms.

You can download it here: <a href="code/filesplitter.cpp.zip">filesplitter.cpp.zip</a>

compile it as:

$ g++ -o splitter filesplitter.cpp

Run

$ ./splitter

It is nice and handy tool to split files. Even it can work as a VCD cutter. It can split dat files :)

Just Enjoy.
