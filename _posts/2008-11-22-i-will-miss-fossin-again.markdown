I didn't get a good opportunity after 2005 to attend FOSS.IN. I have been missing FOSS.INs due to the crap examination schedules. I will have to definitely consider writing to the <a href="http://cusat.ac.in">Cochin University</a> for notifying them about India's premier FOSS event schedules.

I miss it again !

Have a look at <a href="http://foss.in/news/promo-video.html">FOSS.IN Promo video</a>.
