I have been using wordpress since the time I started blogging. I decided to make a move to the Jekyll static templating engine after I came to know about its simplicity and ability to host on github. Blogs are usually immutable once they are written. There is no reason use dynamic pages for blogs. The theme of this blog is based on [jekyll-incorporated](https://github.com/kippt/jekyll-incorporated). I generally don't like the WYSWYG editor that comes with the wordpress. I would prefer to write blog posts on vim as I write code. WYSWYG editors add lots of junk into the generated html. I had to to spend a lot of time migrating those editor generator markup into jekyll plain text. Blog is now hosted on [github](github.com/t3rm1n4l/t3rm1n4l.github.io). Luckly, I could import most of the comments into discuss. I hope to blog more frequently with this transition.
