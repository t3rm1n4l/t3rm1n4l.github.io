Its been around three months the team at Model Engineering College has been working hard to this ultimate day of 'Technopreneur 2009'. Technopreneur is a entrepreneurship and motivational event which presents you different leaders who have changed the path of life. The event is organised by the Young Indians chapter of Model Engineering College.

Even though I had been busy organising FOSSMeet @ MEC, I worked for helping Technopreneur team to build the official website and give some technical consulting. Have a look at my design <a href="http://www.technopreneurmec.org">http://www.technopreneurmec.org</a>. Also I am proud to bring Sarath Babu, Pepsi-MTV Youth Icon 2009 out of my personal contacts as one of our key speakers for the event. Micro$oft, being the title sponsor of the event, I had to put "Build with 100% free software footer" in the website to show people what Free and Open Source Software is capable of. Yep, inorder to nullify the M$ effect :D.

The 2009th edition of Technopreneur was held at Hotel Gokulam Park Inn, Cochin. We had very great speakers from various domains. The event can be broadly classified into four sessions. The first session was about "The role of media in shaping the society". The Anant Parathasarathy, IT Correspondant from THE HINDU newspaper and Mr Manoj from The Indian Express dealt the session. It focussed on the evolution that has changed to the journalism and new strategies of Journalism.

The second session was about Entrepreneurship. The key speakers were Sarath Babu, Pepsi-MTV Youth Icon 2009 and the CEO Fooking Catering and Mr. Kallol Borah of Aumega Networks, Head Start Foundation. Kallol Borah's speech was about getting into technology entrepreneurship and how to become successful and about strategies.

After Kallol's Speech,  Sarath Babu came into the focus. He did an inspirational talk on his story of him, from grassroots level to become a successful entrepreneur and leader. Everybody out there got inspired with his speech. He stands for a real entrepreneur who started from absolutely nothing to very big goals.

Next comes panel discussion on India 2020. There were many famous speakers including Mr. Rear Admiral Rakesh Chopra. It was interesting. The last talk was by Dr. Radhakrishnan, Director of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. He talked about the Chandrayan and the status of India in Space research. The entire event was really awesome.

Most of the time I was spending with Mr Sarath Babu. I had a great time speaking to him. He was talking me about his visions about India. He told that his ultimate wish is to feed every people in India, poverty less India. It is really inspiring story he has. We cannot even imagine his growth. He was born in slums. Now he owns a 9 Core enterprise called Foodking catering which employs a 200 people.  Have a look at this Rediff story <a href="http://ia.rediff.com/money/2006/aug/31spec.htm">http://ia.rediff.com/money/2006/aug/31spec.htm</a>. You would say wow. Recently he was selected as the Pepsi-MTV youth Icon for 2009. Also he is going for Loksabha elections in South Chennai Constituency this time. We must give opportunities for young people like Sarath Babu to be in Loksabha. What does the worst politicians can do at the Loksabha ? They are good for collecting bribe, sleeping at Loksabha. What more ? Since he is from real grass roots of the society, he knows well about the problems of society. I request the voters to think ! Do not make the mistake again.

Speaking to Sarath Babu was a really awesome experience. He is a man down to the earth. I would have to put these buzzwords : Young, Energetic, Intelligent, Strategic, Cool, Social. He told that he had being doing various speeches, of course more than 300 all over the country interrupting his business. He believes that by his speech, at least a few people get really inspired and come forward with entrepreneurship. That's really cool. I have turned out to be his fan :)

The back end of Technopreneur 2009 is more about entrepreneurship. Starting from a bank account of Rs -25000, the Young Indians at Model Engineering College raised around 14 lakhs from scratch through sponsorship and participant fee in short period of time overcoming the global economic recession effect. and moreover its the time when everyone face much more difficulty in in raising sponsorship. Technopreneur team took up the challenge and made it happen. 

See you at Technopreneur 2010 :). It is getting bigger and bigger every year.
