This is the time to unveil the news. Probably, many of my friends know that I was writing the book for last 6 months. Now, it is the proper time to let all of you know that I authored a book on Linux Shell Scripting, The Linux Shell Scripting Cookbook by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com">Packt Publishers, UK</a>.

<a href="http://link.packtpub.com/Ud82pN"><img class="alignleft" title="Book Cover" src="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/3760OS_Linux%20Shell%20Scripting%20Cookbook.jpg" alt="" width="208" height="259" ></a>
<h3>[ Detailed Information ]</h3>
<strong>Language : </strong>English<br />
<strong>Paperback : </strong>360 pages [ 235mm x 191mm ]<br />
<strong>Release Date : </strong>January 2011<br />
<strong>ISBN : </strong>1849513767<br />
<strong>ISBN 13 : </strong>978-1-84951-376-0<br />
<strong>Author(s) : </strong><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/authors/profiles/sarath-lakshman">Sarath Lakshman</a><br />

The book is written in cookbook style and consists of 118 recipes which showcases many real world scripting problems and solutions. The book is divided into 9 chapters based on subjects Basic commands, File related operation, Text processing, Networking, Backup and Archiving, Internet and web, System administration, etc.

I have been using purely GNU/Linux platform for more than 5 years now. UNIX-like operating systems had always amazed me with the command-line experience. The life would have been much difficult without the terminal and command-line. It takes some patient and experience with different problem environments to master the art of command-line and scripting. In many circumstances, problems such as text processing can be performed in one-liner scripts (Crafted line of command by joining pipes and filters). But the same problem can be solved in a very complex way using large number of lines of code. I have compiled many recipes from my experience to teach how to solve problems in simplest and beautiful manner with minimal lines of code.

It was in last April (2010), I happened to see mail from Packt publishers in search of author for Python Cookbook. That is how I thought of writing a book. I felt that experience I gained from shell scripting contests as well as daily usage experience would be enough for me to write a book. The process of authoring book was a good experience apart from my previous experiences on authoring articles for Linux For You. It takes more effort than an initial version of written material to make it to a productive and useful stuff during the editing process. Also I could learn more. The book is available in paperback as well as PDF e-book format.

Anyway, it is something really glad to have a book in hand that I wrote.   I have a dedicated page about my book on this website. Please have a look to <a href="http://www.sarathlakshman.com/my-book">Book page</a>. You can also go through publisher website packtpub.com for buying this book. You can download a sample chapter of the book from <a href="http://www.sarathlakshman.com/my-book">Book page</a> in this website.


I am currently waiting for the paperback author's copy to reach me by post.

Happy Hacking!
