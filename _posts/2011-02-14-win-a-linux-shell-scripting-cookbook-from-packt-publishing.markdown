    Programmers from axiety of packaging, distributing their Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby
    scripts. \r\n\r\nActually I'm tired of those dependencies, modules of Perl, Python,
    Ruby etc (though they hold their rightful place &amp; respect with-in Communities
    &amp; for building , pacjaging &amp; distributing, deploying Complex Application
    \r\n\r\nand I genuinely  believe this Cookbook will help me get best out of Shell,
    combine Shell Scripts with other Scripts &amp; last but not the least share my
    knowledge of doing so with the community!"

    etc which emphasie on learning shell scripting and syntax etc..But this is the
    book that I found that focuses on various tasks (for e.g setting an ethernet and
    wireless lan,Transferring files,listing top 10 cpu consuming processes,and a lot,I
    found the contents on packtpub webpage of this book's table of coontents) that
    can be done by shell scripting rather on teaching elements of shell scripting
    and their syntax,conventional examples.\r\nI feel this is the right book that
    a linux system administrator should have.\r\nThe contents attracted me to avail
    of this book. Great work done by the author..."
