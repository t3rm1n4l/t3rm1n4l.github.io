  content: "HI ,Its me Shamil....sry coolshas124.........., the soft geek....hihihiih....i
    call myself.....as u call yourself \"the innovation lover\"......anyway,....lets
    come to the matter.....i think u already purchased this cam.......And last summer
    vacation , i went to Dubai....And i purchased sony t300....its stylish sleek and
    powerful(i think so).........................\r\n\r\nMy cousin is a photography
    enthusiast and told me to buy SX 100 IS....(really i donno the model no.BUt it
    looks the same....i mean what is in the pic and ma cousin owns the same....,8
    MP , 10x OZ and the same BULKY shape...hihihiihih i say so.......as mine is sleek)......but
    when we visited the canon dealer(authorised , in EMIRATES MALL , DUBAI\"S BIGGEST).........WE
    found tht CANON G8 (i think so) is a little bit more suitable for 'us'......,
    but i has a cos tht it has only 6x or 5x (I'm confused) OZ....But it has got a
    12MP IMAGE SEnSOR.........which is good for us as we use to print most of the
    pics .....................................................\r\n\r\nBut i think
    your new cam is a good bet..as i'm informed by ma Cousin...(WE CALL HIM PHOTY
    nt reaally....,its really PHATY hi hihihiihihih as he is fatty    toooohihihiihi).................................................\r\nHe
    showed us pic which he took frm MIDDLE EAST DESRTS , LODON BRIDGE , PARIS EAFFEL
    TOWER(i doonno the spells) , Frankfurt railway statiuon........etc...,all different
    atmosphere , diff weather,,,different time......BUT ALL IN WHOLE THE PICS WERE
    STUNNING........................................................\r\n\r\n\r\nAS
    bout mine....its not bad,......its too a good bet for 20000 BUCKS...........................\r\n\r\nTHere
    i paid 1800 Dhs...........................................\r\n\r\n\r\nHope u enjoy
    using your new \"EYE\"....which captures the good and memorable things tht your
    mind captures through ya eyes....hihihiihihihihiiiiiiiii ,.......not goin deep\r\n\r\n\r\nI

After several research on different brands of digital cameras, I finally ended up by choosing <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0708/07082004canonsx100is.asp">Canon SX 100 IS</a>. 

<img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/sarathlakshman/SIFGIp40U5I/AAAAAAAAAPM/D8OAkyaX3w4/cam.jpg?imgmax=400" alt="camera" />

<strong>Features:
</strong>
<ul>
<li>10x optical zoom lens with optical Image Stabilizer</li>
    <li> 8.0 Megapixels</li>
    <li> DIGIC III image processor</li>
    <li> Face Detection Technology enhanced with new Face Select and Track function and dedicated Face Selector button</li>
    <li> Canon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s total anti-blur solution with ISO 1600, Auto ISO Shift and optical Image Stabilizer</li>
    <li> Improved Red-Eye Correction in playback</li>
    <li> 2.5&acirc;&euro;¬ù LCD screen</li>
    <li>18 shooting modes including full manual control</li>
    <li> Digital Tele-Converter and Safety Zoom*</li>
</ul>

I have ever been fascinated by good photographs. The quality and beauty of every photograph looks to be artistic. I came to know that my new camera comes with features like shutter speed adjustments, aperture adjustments etc. Have to learn about it in order to snap good pics.

I owned a Canon SX 100 IS :)
