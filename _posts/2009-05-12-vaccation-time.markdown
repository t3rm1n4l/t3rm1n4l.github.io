Finally after long waits vaccation has arrived. It has been around 2 years since I missed out a long vaccation. Cochin university has only 1 month study holidays for first year exams. No post exam holidays are there. But from the second year, the university is good enough to give us two months vaccation.

This time I am going to spend most of my time hacking with Pardus project.

Today I have setup a local repository mirror of Pardus at home :)

Happy Hacking!
