I bought an AVR-32 ATNGW100 embedded experimentation board. It runs a minature version of GNU/Linux on AVR archietecture. The NGW100 has two Ethernet ports, SD and MMC card reader, and connectors for USB and JTAG. It boots up soon after it is given power supply. The version of OS includes decent services like SSH, SAMBA, FTP etc.

My initial plan is to build an internet gateway with iptables hack. Also I plan to cross-compile <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">SQUID</a> for AVR so that I can have an embeded tiny sized proxy server with all controls. That can be used at hostel for sharing internet connection Tux powered :) Looking forward to it.
