  content: Hi, good post. I have been wondering about this issue, so thanks for posting.

I'm living without connectivity and computers during these days. 
Yeah. I'm now a first year Computer Science and Engineering student at <a href="http://www.mec.ac.in">Model Engg College, Thrikkakara</a>.

I live at Men's Hostel(MH) of the college, Room No. 124 in a small box room. Life is truly horrible these days..No computer access, Internet.. Little bit of Seniority - juniority issues and more.

First year syllabus is truly bull shit. I have to learn a lot of non-techie subjects like Basic Civil Engg, Environmental science etc. They are all just like crap windows viruses. Irritating me under an infinite loop.

These environment is making me leak my passions of FOSS. 
God.. Could you please bring me a laptop with connectivity at hostel :D
