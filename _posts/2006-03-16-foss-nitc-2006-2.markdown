My next program is at <a href="http://nitc.ac.in">NIT, Calicut</a>. GLUG is going to conduct a two day FOSS Fest (18th and 19th). :) I will be doing 'Live CD Workshop' there. My schedule is on 18th, 2 pm. I am very excited.

I like NIT, Calicut well. Last year after the release of SLYNUX, I was invited to NITC for last year's FOSS program. I heard a technical talk from there for the first time in my life. It was delivered by <a href="http://atulchitnis.net">Atul Chitnis</a>. I cannot forget that moment ever. It was my seed of open source world exposure.
