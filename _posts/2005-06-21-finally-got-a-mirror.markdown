I was trying to setup a mirror for downloading SLYNUX ISO image for past few days. Luckly few guys from NIT, Calicut helped me out. I was earlier hosting ISO myself on my website and was hosting bandwidth restrictions and outages. Now anyone can goahead and download SLYNUX without any bandwidth problems.
