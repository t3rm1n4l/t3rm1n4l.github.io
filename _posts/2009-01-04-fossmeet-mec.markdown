Hey !

Here is an interesting piece of news.

The team at <a href="http://www.mec.ac.in">Model Engineering College</a> is glad to announce that we are going to host FOSSMeet @ MEC on January 25th 2009. I expect this event would help us to join hands with FOSS Communities in India and start contributing to Free software. We are trying hard to make this event a grant success.

I invite all Free Software enthusiasts to FOSSMeet @ MEC. Please explore <a href="http://mec.fossmeet.in">http://mec.fossmeet.in</a> for details.

See you at FOSSMeet !
